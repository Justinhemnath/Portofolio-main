          <h1>
            <i className="fa-solid fa-circle fa-beat"></i>Why 
            front-end web development and React Js in specific?
          </h1>
          
          <p>As far as I can remember, I've always had a mouse 
             and keyboard at the end of my hands. When my father 
             was done with his work by the evening, he would let
             me use the computer. I grew up watching windows evolve 
             from 95 to XP and surprised by the colors and theme 
             with every new windows. So a career in the IT field 
             was always in mind.
          </p>

          <p>During my one year stint as a language editor 
             at an E-publishing firm, I knew I needed a bigger  
             challenge and decided to pursue the programming 
             path. I've had a few goes at teaching myself Java 
             and Python through youtube, upto creating functions 
             and playing with string methods. Due to the lack
             of a CS degree and exposure to different 
             programming fields I wasn't sure which career 
             path would suit me until I discovered web 
             development. Furthermore, the react ecosystem 
             of making resuable components got me very much 
             hooked up with front-end web development. Since 
             then I've been learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and 
             React Js through books, Udemy courses by Stephen 
             Grider, Maximilian Schwarzmuller and Jonas 
             Schmedtmann, thousands of youtube videos, plenty 
             of googling and of course, Stack Overflow. I want 
             to further learn web development by getting
             into the back-end and database sides of software 
             engineering by becoming a <b>MERN</b> stack  
             developer (<b>M</b>ongoDB, <b>E</b>xpressJs, <b>R</b>eactJs, <b>N</b>odeJs). 
          </p>
